# Pi-calculator
Java project that calculate digits of Pi.


tan(Ï€/4) = 1

therefore

4arctan(1) = Ï€

d/dx arctan = 1/1+x^2

taylor series of 1/1+x^2 = 1 -x^2 + x^4 ...

therefore

taylor series of arctanx = x/1 - x^3/3 + x^5/5 ...

evaluate this infinit sum at 1 ---> it tends to be Pi

and thats it.
